One of the things I have to say was how some people‚Äôs answers in this video to non-judgmental questions was unnecessarily judgmental and even a bit closed-minded to the circumstances of others.

That‚Äôs probably not what they were saying, but should someone pay more to be healthy then would be my question to that person‚Äôs response to the original inquiry. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not expensive at all to eat Vegan..,‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the question at all, the statement in which to agree or disagree was, ‚ÄúIt costs more to eat healthier.‚Äù That statement that person made to explain their view of the statement to me made me feel like the person was closed-minded to other diets, healthy foods, or techniques that are out there other than being vegan. Not everyone can be vegan, and that‚Äôs a fact, so if she didn‚Äôt know the answer to that, I wish she had simply said that she can only look at it from her own perspective.

Oh really that's interesting because I suppose you don't know that hundreds of hectares of the Amazon rain forest are cut down every day just so your precious soy plant can meet the demands of the west. In this process 100 of species loss the habitats and uncontacted tribes get gunned down. 

Also did you happen know that every time you turn or your lights, wich are powered by electricity, your indirectly killing animals because of the fossil files that had to be burnt to give you that electricity. Wich causes coral bleaching and and the destruction of polar habitats.

What I'm saying is even if you are vegan. It's impossible to live a mordern lifestyle without indirectly harming funa and flora.
