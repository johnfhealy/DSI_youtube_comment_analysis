One of the things I have to say was how some people’s answers in this video to non-judgmental questions was unnecessarily judgmental and even a bit closed-minded to the circumstances of others. Like, “I’m willing to spend the extra dollar to eat healthy...,” kinda sets the undertone that the people who believe it’s expensive are cheap. That’s probably not what they were saying, but should someone pay more to be healthy then would be my question to that person’s response to the original inquiry. “It’s not expensive at all to eat Vegan..,” wasn’t the question at all, the statement in which to agree or disagree was, “It costs more to eat healthier.” That statement that person made to explain their view of the statement to me made me feel like the person was closed-minded to other diets, healthy foods, or techniques that are out there other than being vegan. Not everyone can be vegan, and that’s a fact, so if she didn’t know the answer to that, I wish she had simply said that she can only look at it from her own perspective. From my perspective, I understood she was coming from her own place of awareness, but it can be views like she was not really answering the question but just trying to hard-sell the vegan diet.",0.0,0,False,

Oh really that's interesting because I suppose you don't know that hundreds of hectares of the Amazon rain forest are cut down every day just so your precious soy plant can meet the demands of the west. In this process 100 of species loss the habitats and uncontacted tribes get gunned down. 

Also did you happen know that every time you turn or your lights, wich are powered by electricity, your indirectly killing animals because of the fossil files that had to be burnt to give you that electricity. Wich causes coral bleaching and and the destruction of polar habitats.

What I'm saying is even if you are vegan. It's impossible to live a mordern lifestyle without indirectly harming funa and flora.
