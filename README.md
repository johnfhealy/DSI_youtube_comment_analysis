# DSI_youtube_comment_analysis


The Goal of this project was to compare sentiment between meat-eaters and Vegans/Vegetarians. 

Data was collected from a YouTube video where meat-eaters and vegans debate the tenants of each diet. This particular video was chosen because of an inherent lack of bias from the producers of the video. 

A classifier was created to determine whether each comment was made by a vegan/vegetarian or meat-eater. The model worked with 91.5% accuracy, but the classes were very imbalanced. This makes sense.Since most of the world does eat meat, the overwhelming majority of viewers and commenters are likely to be meat-eaters. 

The project is still a work-in-progress. Ideally, I would like to run the same type of model on data from different videos with the same subject matter and compare polarity distribution scores.
